# Google Dinosaur Mimic

This repository contains a clone of the Google dinosaur game, powered by an AI to play the game
At the moment the AI is a simple NN (Neural Network) with some of genetic algorithms techniques 
to find the best weights.

# Techonlogies
- Python
- Numpy
- Pygame

# How to Run

```
python src/game.py --top 3 --population 400

```

# Next steps
- Improve the code base
- Improve the NN to somenthing from the state of art (Maybe Q-learning)
- Improve the readme
